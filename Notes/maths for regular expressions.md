# Regex Maths

Regexes can be used to evaluate numeric sets

`N = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`
`Z = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}`

## Set Comprehension

$\{ x \mid x \in \mathbb{N} \land \ge 1\} $

This set holds all values of x where x is a natural number and x >= 1

### Types of Sets

- Finite sets have a fixed number of elements with a $ |S| \in \mathbb{N} $
- Infinite sets have an infinite amount of elements, for example $\mathbb{N} $
- Countably Infinite sets are infinite, but countable

**Cardinality** = the size of a set, $ |S| $
