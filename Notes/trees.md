# Trees

A tree is a graph that takes the form of a tree. It is undirected and with no cycles (only 1 path between any pair of vertices)

A **rooted tree** has a designated vertex as the root

A **binary tree** is a rooted tree with a maximum of 2 children per node

You can use binary trees to sort a list by using the pattern `smaller than node => left, bigger => right`
